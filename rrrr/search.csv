"1371108:311667","TriMax Media is one of the leading online advertising agencies specializing in pay for performance search engine marketing. TriMax has been quietly and substantially increasing traffic for many of the largest online retailers for over 12 years.

Because TriMax focuses on creating highly effective search marketing campaigns and developing successful long‐term relationships with their merchant partners, they are very selective when choosing the retailers they are able to assist. 

For those retailers that qualify, following are the benefits of working with TriMax Media as a search partner –

Experience - 
•	Served on the first Google Advertiser Research Council in 2004.
•	Selected as a Charter Member of the CJ Performer Program in 2005.
•	Participant in many Google Beta Trials over the years including the initial AdWords Editor Beta Trial in 2005.
•	One of the first companies to generate over one million leads for its clients utilizing Google AdWords in 2006.

TriMax Media's CEO, who maintains an active role in the campaign creation process, has been creating advertising campaigns for over 25 years. This experience and expertise enables TriMax to provide merchants with high quality ads that vastly outperform competitor’s ads with incredibly high click‐through rates that result in increased traffic and sales. Achieving these results requires more than an understanding of the mechanics of AdWords, Bing or Yahoo. It requires an understanding of direct response marketing that can only be gained by years of studying the masters of the craft and spending millions of dollars refining methodology on thousands of campaigns.

Risk Avoidance - TriMax Media assumes all financial risk of their advertising campaigns for their merchant partners and is compensated strictly based on commission of sales. This allows merchants to pay only for converted sales after they occur instead of paying all internal PPC campaign costs regardless of conversion. This compensation structure also offers benefits to merchants over the percent of ad spend or flat rate structure that many agencies charge by ensuring their campaigns are constantly optimized for maximum ROI and increased traffic instead of maximum ad spend.

New Search Engine Technologies Beta and Pilot Opportunities - Since TriMax Media works closely with dedicated Agency Strategists and Account Managers at all major search engines as a Google AdWords Certified Partner and Bing Ads Accredited Professional Company, they are offered opportunities to participate in many beta and pilot programs. They implement these new technologies in select merchant campaigns before they are available to the general public to give their merchant partners an edge in the competitive landscape.

Brand Control - TriMax Media represents merchant partner brands in a professional manner consistent with website branding and internal advertising campaigns. They work to tie campaign ad copy to merchant website and promotion verbiage for a consistent brand representation and user experience. Their goal is always to complement any internal search campaigns and work with internal teams to expand on their search efforts to increase exposure and traffic for the merchant website.

Compliance and Site Monitoring - TriMax Media assists in monitoring the search engines for misuse or misrepresentation of merchant trademark terms and provides this as a complimentary service to their merchant partners.

Focus - TriMax Media is focused solely on developing outstanding pay per click advertising campaigns.

Communication - TriMax Media understands the importance of merchant and search partner communication and proactively maintains timely and open lines of communication.

Contribution - TriMax Media contributes a minimum of 10 percent of profits to charitable organizations.

If you are interested in learning more about a possible partnership with TriMax Media, please reach out."

Your company is the legal owner (registrant) of the acquired domain names right from the start, and we will forward the traffic from each domain name through your affiliate program, earning your standard commission rate on resulting conversions.  We focus exclusively on domain names and direct navigation traffic (we do not use or permit keyword bidding or search campaigns that use your brand name(s) or variations thereof) and report to you the domain names we acquire on your behalf.  With this program, we have also found that clients can generate enough incremental affiliate revenue to fund or entirely offset their domain name spend with CSC.

The approach I take with any advertiser is where are customers at that my advertiser isn't. Generally I look for untapped markets in the search engines, focus a website specifically on that product/advertiser and pull the untapped audience to it through SEM.

This allows us to buy contextually relevant media placements on our clients behalf, which we generally direct link to the affiliate advertisers site to generate purchases. This is different from paid search in that we are not buying Google's search engine result listings, but rather using Google's network of Adsense enabled properties to help promote deals and advertisements for our affiliate partners.

We do not believe that this in any way violates most advertisers explicit paid search policies, but in order to be fully transparent we want to have full disclosure in this activity. Because Google is the operator of their Display Ad Network, there URL sometimes show up as the referring domain. Again, we feel that this is an additive tactic to an affiliate advertiser's own marketing efforts, and not a competing tactic like paid search bidding would be.

When using the Google Display Network, we use keyword groups to signal to Google what type of editorial content we want our ads to show up next to. This sometimes includes a brand's own terms, so that we may show up next to articles featuring that brand's products or that mention specific brands. By buying these terms, it is not uncommon for our ads to show up on parked domains and/or misspelled domains. While we believe this is beneficial to a brand so that they have the best chance of capturing that interested user, if this is a practice your are not comfortable with we can take measures to minimize and/or eliminate this type of placement.

Our goal with this activity is to find lesser utilized tactics to help brands generate more sales, and to get compensated as part of that process. If this is not something you are comfortable with or you have further questions, please let us know. Terms and conditions compliance is of utmost importance to us, and we want to work with brands to identify activities and tactics that support both the brand's and our objectives mutually."

"4347167:294633","I create websites and blogsites promoting my advertiser's products.  To promote my own website to lead to sales I use natural search engine promotion, paid search engine promotion through, google, bing, and facebook.  One example of a website I have made is nyctourpass.com.  It is a professional looking and feeling website that promotes and brings awareness to the money you can save with the NewYorkPass, and other city passes.  I also use blogger, twitter, hubpages and other blogging sites to bring traffic to my own website which leads to clicks to the companies I am affiliated with.  I just applied to use social media to post tweets on my twitter account that will be associated with my website to sometimes directly lead people on twitter on a sale or so forth.  I will also use facebook to make a post to lead people to my advertisers purchase page.  Once again each social media account is related to the product it is publishing about and will only look and feel professional and not out of place and forced.  My main method though is driving traffic to my own website because I feel with the content I have on my website where I talk up the products as much as possible is the action I feel suited best for myself and my advertisers to make money!"
