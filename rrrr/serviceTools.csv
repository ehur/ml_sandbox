CitizenHawk, acquired in 2013 by Corsearch, a Wolters Kluwer business, is a leading provider of Online Brand Protection solutions.  Our technology empowers you to monitor, protect and enforce proper use of your brand, online. 

Our patented Brand Protection and Trademark Monitoring technology identifies instances of infringement and provides detailed reports of abuse.  Next, we interrogate and cluster data gleaned from our monitoring efforts to identify aliases and common threads of information.  Our experienced team uses this information to determine the best approach to take down infringing domains.  Using our proprietary database of known infringers, we’ll let you know the best path to take; whether a simple email can be effective, if you need to issue a cease and desist letter, or if a Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP) filing is necessary.

We offer flexible payment terms that seamlessly fit into your existing budget.  Choose a flat, monthly fee or opt for our Pay-for-Performance plan, which is funded through your affiliate marketing program.  Simply select us as an affiliate and we’ll get right to work identifying infringing domains targeting your brand.  

All recovered domains are registered to your company and all traffic is directed back to you through your approved affiliate network.  We cover all recovered domain hosting expenses, transfer costs and renewal costs and become the administrative and technical contact for the domain.  If customers purchase your products through these domains, we are paid a commission on the sale for a contracted period of time.  

After the contracted period, the domains are transferred back to you, and your internal team is named as the administrative and technical contact.

It’s that simple.  Get started today.  Contact sales@citizenhawk.com for your personalized brand audit."

"3603713:281544","Fashion LoveStruck is a blog about the latest fashion trends and style tips. 

As the blog started gaining more traffic and followers, we started receiving requests for personal styling, since our viewers admired the outfit ideas posted.

The way we started doing this is the person requesting this service would give me their credit card number, and I would go and shop for them online as a their personal shopper. Basically the same process as a traditional 'personal shopper' would do, but rather then shop in physical stores, I do this with online stores, especially with the ones I am already affiliated.


As we started to receive more and more requests from women satisfied with this styling service, we started working on developing a quiz to help us collect more detailed style preference information from each client. This would help us be more efficient in in virtually shopping for clothes suitable for the client.


As we developed this quiz, we started adding other features revolved around this service to make this styling service more convenient for the customer. Currently, new clients who come across the blog are re-directed to our custom forms, which collects all of the clients' data and stores in our database.


We then go purchase clothes for the client, and we send the complete outfit to the customer. If the customer decides to return anything, we manage the returns for the client to make it more convenient. Often times, the clothing comes from all different places in different times; we discovered through trial and error that our clients really appreciate this styling service when we manage the buying and returns from our end."
