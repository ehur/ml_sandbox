The toolbar has three redirect options to accommodate each advertiser’s
preferences: “automatic”, “action required from user”, and “go through
Memolink.com” redirects.  Of course, the advertiser can always opt-out of
participating in the toolbar.  Please contact Annmarie at athorne@adperio.com

We have a very sophisticated system that allows us to set up customized Malls for organizations all across the country. We run the Mall but it is replicated for every org.

 Once it is in place we give the org a team of Specialists who create professional marketing emails that go out on a weekly basis to all the supporters in that organization through a free autoresponder system we provide them.  There is never any SPAM – all are permission based. 

Right now we are sending emails to 100,000 + supporters, with the number going up weekly as we add organizations. From every purchase that is made on the Mall, 75%  of the profits go back to the organization, giving the supporters strong incentive to shop. We are proud to have the largest online Mall created for Non-profits and hope you will partner with us. Our motto is that if it can be bought, it can be bought in our Mall. We profile merchants on a weekly basis – and hope you will be one of them.

"1788447:88873","This site is a CashBack Rewards Mall operated by Very Important Relationships, Inc., but is a mirror of the technology used in all malls.  VIR is a premier  developers of CashBack Rewards mall  technology and operates platforms that serve seven different industry. Each mall platforms offers over 3,000 of the Internet's most recognized stores. 

VIR is not a B2C business model, but instead builds and operates custom malls for its clients. These malls are used as ""value added"" enhancements to increase customer/employee stickiness (in the case of a customer loyalty platforms), or enhance product value (in the case of a ""value added"" service). All of VIR's software code is propriety and has been developed exclusively by VIR.  

VIR only markets to organizations with an audience established through an affinity relationship. This means it is their brand that instills confidence with the customer.   VIR's clients are major corporations that offer a VIR CashBack mall as a employee benefit to their employers; nonprofit organizations that offer the malls to their supporters to help raise needed support funds, associations that offer it as a membership benefit, or as a customer loyalty reward by companies to their customers. As such VIR does not use any form of external promotion methods to promote these platforms to the general public. 

VIR malls are designed as a one place URL to get all of your Internet shopping needs met. This means the malls all include merchant and product search capabilities, Hot Deals and Promo Codes offered by the merchants to attract customers, web browser extensions to identify merchants in generic search results, and a mobile application to access affiliated merchants  when a member is not at their desktop.

VIR does not actively promote its malls to the general public but instead relies on clients to promote their malls to their affinity audience. Several VIR mall platforms are closed to the general public and require a sponsor ID to even register. Additionally, VIR does not bid on key words as VIR malls are not optimized for SEO.

VIR does send emails to its registered members (after their registration and approval)  on an opt-in only basis that sometimes highlight specials offered by the affiliate merchants. All emails are CSPAM complainant and contain opt-out links at the bottom should a member which to stop receiving them. 

VIR's entire system is 100% database driven. This means the engines which create each web page in a particular shopping platform do so at the time the page is called by the member, which is based on the login session of the member.  This technology provides VIR the ability to fully control all activity originating from its sites with full tracking control of every members activity in any VIR platform. 

In order for a person to be able to shop in any VIR mall they must first become a registered member. The registration requires that a new member submit their name, email and other personal information, plus agree to:

1) VIR's Privacy Policy http://cashbackheaven.com/help/privacy;

2) Terms of Use http://cashbackheaven.com/help/termsofuse; and 

3) Membership Agreement http://cashbackheaven.com/help/membership. 

A member's email becomes their login name and only one email address can be used per VIR platform. This prevents a person from creating more accounts that they have legitimate email addresses, which under our system does not provide any additional benefit anyway.

When a person logs into a VIR platform, their email is looked up in a table which identifies who they are, under which portal sponsor they have registered and then brands the mall accordingly. Every time a member logs into a VIR platform, the platform knows who they are. Every banner created for ever merchant contains special code that among other things, identifies who the actual customer is that clicked on the banner."

"2400404:138937","nonprofitshoppingmall,com donates 50 - 60% of profits back to nonprofit organization chosen by consumer.  Percentage back to nonprofit depends on size and scope of organization."
"2400404:257413","Nonprofitshoppingmall.com allows consumers to shop online for the things they would normally buy, from the brands they would normally choose, at the prices they would normally pay. However, when a consumer chooses to shop through Nonprofitshoppingmall.com, a donation is also made to their favorite charity. Here's what happens:<br>
<br>
All of the retailers and/or service providers listed on the site pay a commission to NPSM for sales that originate through the NPSM website. NPSM then donates a significant portion of those payments to the nonprofit selected by the consumer. The percentage noted beneath each retailer's logo represents the percentage of each consumer's purchase that is donated to the consumer's designated nonprofit. That percentage varies from retailer to retailer, and is fully disclosed on our website, along with direct links to the retailers' sites.<br>
<br>
The percentage of sales that will benefit the designated nonprofit is based on the product sales price after any discounts or coupons, and excludes state sales taxes and shipping fees. Some retailers do not pay sales commissions on certain items purchased through their websites, so purchases of those items will not benefit your designated nonprofit. For example, Wedding Registry Gifts often fall into this exceptions category. Please visit the retailer's webpage for a list of their exclusions.<br>
<br>
We have an EZ Shopper App that simplifies the donation process by detecting the site you are on and matching it with our retailer database. It allows you to keep shopping without having to revisit the nonprofitshoppingmall.com site or any of our nonprofit partner private label sites. <br>

Advertisers may choose to be excluded from the toolbar add-in and still be offered on the normal cash back shopping site. It is 100% opt-in for end users, who can install it directly from our site with a two-click confirmation process, and can uninstall it at any time via the browser's standard add-in management. The toolbar allows the user to search our database for merchants and products at any time, and displays information from their account. It also passively monitors visited URLs, and will alert the users via a dialog when they can receive cash back on a site. Users can choose whether or not to accept this offer - if they accept, then we route them to a decorated URL that includes our publisher information.

user really wants, and that is more expensive than the original item. Our

GlobalMojo is on a mission to make the world a better place by leveraging Internet technology to
benefit incredible non-profits, schools, and many other deserving organizations. Our shopping page
and free browser app, called the Giving Assistant, influences consumers’ online shopping behavior.
This leads to increased conversion rates that create solid ROI for advertisers.
The evolution of the Giving Assistant is important to highlight. As GlobalMojo started growing
through white label shopping pages we surveyed users about ongoing usage. We found that while
many of our users liked the concept of shopping for their favorite cause and were willingly to make a
purchase decision to support their favorite cause, the number one complaint was that they did not like
being forced to shop from a single web page. The consequence of forcing users to substantially change
their current online behavior was that their usage dropped substantially over time.
This is where the Giving Assistant comes in. This browser app makes the purchase decisions easy and
seamless because it integrates into the users current online shopping and browsing experience. We do
this by creating a customized shopping experience by inserting icons and tool bar dropdowns that let
fans and supporters of the cause know with merchants we work within each of our affiliate network
partners.
Distribution of the Giving Assistant

Your store will be featured in our directory, and you will start seeing purchases from our site nearly instantly. 

We are new to Commission Junction, but have a proven track record with Amazon (>$100k/month in purchases) and ebay (>$70k/month) (results 02/2013)

Please approve us as a publisher and let us help you generate sales. 

Thank You,

Bunddler.com Team."

"3789076:299925","UspendNsave.com: The First Cash Back Referral Network.

UspendNsave.com is a groundbreaking website based on a unique business model. Did you know that Major retailers award Referral Sales Commissions?

Every time you buy any product or service, a commission is generated. But retailers don’t just share that commission with anyone. UspendNsave.com has negotiated with Hundreds of Partner Retailers so it can share 80% of those Referral Commissions with you. UspendNsave.com cash rewards are additional money to your current Loyalty, Points, Miles or Cash Back programs.

With a strong networking character, UspendNsave.com makes it easy for you to save -and earn- tons of money thanks to a TEAM structure that guarantee an exponential growth of your earnings.

UspendNsave.com is not a Multi-level marketing company. It doesn’t sell anything or make you buy anything. Despite its network concept, it’s just a platform on which you can build a life plan, optimize your savings and earn cash just by spending as you’re used to spend and being good with team work. That is what we call ""The Power of Community"" (Together Earn More).

 

UspendNsave.com Promise &amp; Code of Ethics:

We share 80% of Referral Commissions with you and your TEAM

We will never sell Products or Services

The members’ earned money is deposited in a bank account

You have a detailed statement of your earnings at all times

You can withdraw your money at any time (Debit Card or Pay Pal)

We will credit your commissions as soon as we receive them

There is a detailed explanation of our relationship

We respect your Privacy and safeguard your Information

Always offer a written explanation that you can easily understand

We Respond your questions as soon as possible

We help Entrepreneurs to Start their Online business

 

So… how does it work? Let me give you an example: Say you book a trip with your favorite online agency as a UspendNsave.com member. You will receive around 5% in cash back to your UspendNsave.com account. That is solid money you can then use for whatever you want 

You can shop from thousands of top brands and all kinds of products and services like Electronics, Home Appliances, Clothing, Pharmacy, Fragances. Something very important is that you buy directly from Retailers.

 

What are the Costs to join the Program?  NONE: No monthly fees, no credit cards, no obligations. Just sign up, and if you want, recommend Friends. Then you can just log into UspendNsave and search by Store, Deal or Product, click and you will be saving and earning cash back.Take advantage of daily updated Coupons, Discounts and special offers from our UspendNsave.com’s Partner Retailers.

Another easy but powerful way to bust your earnings is to recommend friends and family to join the program. What if you collect commissions from your friends and the friends of your friends purchases?

That is the UspendNsave TEAM Builder system. Collecting great earnings by just recommending. What is a TEAM CLUB? Is the way UspendNsave awards a Member’s effort based on the number of total Members within their TEAM.

The TEAM CLUB structure is related to CHALLENGES, which are a step by step guide to help you reach the next level. You receive a formal recognition for your TEAM CLUB status with a Diploma plus tickets to participate in the monthly ""Dream Big UspendNsave Sweepstakes”.

You only need to be a Member (at No Cost) and refer friends by entry their First Name, Last Name and email into the system to invite them to become Members.

Once they are Members and start purchasing from Top Retailers you will receive commissions from their and their friend’s transactions. Imagine how many members can be part of your TEAM with a very small effort."
